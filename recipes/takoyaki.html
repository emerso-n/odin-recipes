          Now while takoyaki are typically filled with octopus meat, takoyaki's
          predecessor was filled with beef!
          <br />
          So exactly what is takoyaki? The English translation - Japanese
          octopus balls - might not create the right image! Takoyaki is a round,
          fried food made from batter, small pieces of tender octopus and other
          ingredients, like green onions and ginger. They are considered a
          Japanese street food are popular at festivals, often prepared from
          food stands right in front of the prospective customers.
          <br />
          Takoyaki - commonly known in English as Japanese octopus balls - is a
          quintessential Japanese street food that's found especially at summer
          festivals in Japan. Essentially they're round balls of fluffy dough
          that are smothered with a special savory takoyaki sauce and have a
          tasty piece of octopus meat at the center.
          <br />
          Follow along as we share more about this Japanese snack, how takoyaki
          is made, and discover why they're such an addictive treat!
          <br />
          However, takoyaki can also be found being sold at convenience stores,
          food trucks, and in people's homes as well! Though, be warned,
          takoyaki is usually served piping hot! So be sure to give it time to
          cool while you sip on a beer.
          <br />
          Takoyaki is said to originally be from Osaka, where, according to one
          theory, a street vendor called Tomekichi Endo invented this delicious
          octopus dish in 1935. However, it wasn't an invention out of the blue
          but rather an adaption of a previous version.
          <br />
          Supposedly, it all started with another dish called choboyaki, the
          prototype of takoyaki as we know it today. Choboyaki is rather similar
          in ingredients, but in appearance it is more like a flat rectangle
          rather than individual balls.
          <br />
          From choboyaki evolved rajioyaki, likely named after the newest, most
          popular invention of the time: the radio. The characteristic ball
          shape was introduced with rajioyaki, and the dish was generally filled
          with beef. When the beef filling was replaced with octopus cuts,
          Japanese octopus balls - takoyaki - was born.
          <br />
          Ever since then, the dish has conquered the taste buds of Japan by
          storm. It is a staple food of Japanese festivals, sold in stalls
          called yatai, and can also be found in shops and restaurants all
          around the country. Likewise, different regional varieties of takoyaki
          have developed over time as the dish has migrated.Takoyaki can also
          easily be made at home. Making takoyaki without the aforementioned
          takoyaki pan is rather impossible, as the batter will not stay in the
          characteristic ball shape. Worry not, however, as such pans are
          available both all over Japan and all over the internet, even outside
          of Japan.
          <br />
          As making takoyaki is merely a matter of minutes as long as the batter
          is readily made, it's an extremely popular party food that, if you
          have a portable gas cooker, can be cooked and enjoyed right at the
          table!
          <br />
          While the classic takoyaki is of course made with octopus, this should
          by no means keep you from trying out all sorts of ingredients to put
          inside the savory batter - especially if you, your family, or your
          friends aren't fans of eating octopus. Sausages, cheese, all sorts of
          vegetables, tofu: try whatever strikes your fancy!
          <br />
          The only important thing regarding takoyaki? Make sure to eat them
          right out of the pan, as they're the most delicious when they're fresh
          and piping hot!
          <br />
          Now that we know what is takoyaki, when do Japanese eat it? Takoyaki
          goes with Japanese summer festivals like ketchup goes with French
          fries. At stalls and restaurants, takoyaki is often served in paper
          dishes resembling little boats. Don't be surprised when you're served
          a toothpick instead of chopsticks to eat your takoyaki with.
          <br />
          Spear the ball and try to eat it while taking care not to burn your
          mouth! There's nothing more satisfying than to snack on freshly made
          takoyaki while celebrating two heavenly lovers at the Tanabata
          festival, after dancing the bon-odori during Obon, or while watching
          magnificent Japanese summer fireworks.

                Heat たこ焼き pan to 400°F over medium heat. Using a brush, oil
                the pan. When you see smoke rising from the pan, generously pour
                the batter to fill the chambers
              </li>
              <li>
                Add 1-3 octopus pieces to each chamber and sprinkle the かつお節

                Sprinkle the 天かす, green onion, and 紅しょうが on top. After 3
                minutes, when the batter on the bottom of the balls has set and
                is slightly crispy, use skewers to break the connected batter
                between each ball. Then rotate each piece 90 degrees toward the
                bottom of the pan, stuffing the connected dough back into the
                ball to help form a ball shape. The uncooked batter will flow
                out from inside each たこ焼き to create another side of the
