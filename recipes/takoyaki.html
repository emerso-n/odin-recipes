      Takoyaki is said to originally be from Osaka, where, according to one theory, a street vendor called Tomekichi Endo invented this delicious octopus dish in 1935. However, it wasn't an invention out of the blue but rather an adaption of a previous version.
      <br />
      Supposedly, it all started with another dish called choboyaki, the prototype of takoyaki as we know it today. Choboyaki is rather similar in ingredients, but in appearance it is more like a flat rectangle rather than individual balls.
      <br />
      From choboyaki evolved rajioyaki, likely named after the newest, most popular invention of the time: the radio. The characteristic ball shape was introduced with rajioyaki, and the dish was generally filled with beef. When the beef filling was replaced with octopus cuts, Japanese octopus balls - takoyaki - was born.
      <br />
      Ever since then, the dish has conquered the taste buds of Japan by storm. It is a staple food of Japanese festivals, sold in stalls called yatai, and can also be found in shops and restaurants all around the country. Likewise, different regional varieties of takoyaki have developed over time as the dish has migrated.
