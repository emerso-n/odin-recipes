    <p>
      Ramen noodles in its simplest form is Chinese wheat noodles in soup broth.
      Although introduced originally from China, Japan has created an entire
      cult-like obsession making Ramen anything but simple.
      <br />

      In Japan, Ramen shops and Ramen making are considered a culinary art and
      Japanese people line up for hours to try a bowl made by a master Ramen
      chef. Some Ramen restaurants are so popular, there are line-ups hours
      before the shop is even open.
      <br />
      Ramen in Japan is also quite diverse with different kinds of broths,
      toppings and noodle styles as well as regional variations. Different
      areas, cities, and even shops have their own twist on Ramen preparation
      and ingredients making each Ramen experience different and unique.
      <br />
      Let's take a look at some of the different types of Ramen styles available
      in Japan and their distinct qualities and tastes so you can decide which
      Ramen is right for you.
      <br />
      Before getting into the details of each type of Ramen, the main thing to
      note is the soup broth is usually made from pork, chicken, beef or fish
      bones that are boiled for a long time as well as a seasoning that is mixed
      in with it to create a distinct taste.
      <br />
      The type of noodles used in Ramen are made with flour and a salty alkaline
      liquid called kansui. It is kansui mixed in with other ingredients and the
      flour that is central to the creation and classification of Ramen.
      <br />
      You will notice that some soup broths are very thin and clear while others
      are cloudy and thick. As well, the variety of noodles from thick to thin,
      straight to curly are all different forms of the Ramen noodle. The color,
      texture, flavor and look of a bowl of Ramen can be quite different yet
      still fall into the Ramen category as long as both noodles and soup broth
      follow the Ramen rules.
      <br />
      Another great way to distinguish your Ramen and add a variety of flavor is
      with the vast amounts of toppings available. Here are some of the most
      popular toppings Japanese people add to their Ramen.
      <br />
      1. Chashu/Char Siu Pork Many bowls already come with this topping but if
      not it is definitely a popular topping as an add on. Chashu is roasted or
      braised fatty pork that has been soaked and simmered in a sweet soy sauce
      seasoning. 2. Negi (Leek) Chopped green onions or leeks are also usually a
      standard topping already sprinkled atop the noodles adding flavor,
      aesthetic, and texture variety. Once again, if your Ramen doesn't already
      include it, adding this topping will enhance texture and taste in the
      Ramen. 3. Menma Menma is a preserved and fermented bamboo shoots with a
      salty flavor and slightly crunchy texture that goes well with the soup
      broth and noodles. 4. Eggs Sliced in half or sometimes whole, eggs are a
      popular topping for Ramen. Boiled, lightly boiled, or marinated in a sweet
      soy sauce flavoring, eggs add to the heartiness of a bowl of Ramen. 5.
      Bean sprouts Called moyashi in Japanese, bean sprouts are a cheap and
      popular ingredient in many Japanese foods like stir-fry, rice and soups.
      They are served either cooked or raw with Ramen and have a nice crunch to
      them. 6. SeaweedMany people also enjoy adding different types of seaweed
      like nori or wakame to their Ramen for added taste and as a healthy
      topping choice as seaweed is high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
      <br />
      Ramen shops are usually pretty casual and made for quick order, eating and
      exiting. Many people also eat Ramen when they are on the go so you will
      find most Ramen restaurants have a lot of counter space for single diners
      as well as tables. Menus in Ramen shops tend to have a lot fewer options
      than other restaurants as most people are there for the basic Ramen,
      gyoza, and rice sets.
      <br />
      Before finding a seat you might want to check if there is a vending
      machine by the entrance. For convenience and efficiency, many Ramen shops
      ask customers to order their specific orders in advance via a vending
      machine before finding a seat. The staff takes the ticket and brings the
      order to you. Since payment is already taken care of, people can eat at
      their own pace and leave after eating without hassle.
      <br />
      If there is no vending machine, a staff member will take your order, bring
      your order to you and after you eat you will bring the bill to the counter
      for payment like most restaurants in Japan.
      <br />
      7. Kamaboko and Naruto A cured and processed fish cake product, kamaboko
      is sliced thinly and served atop Ramen. The Naruto version is a white and
      pink spiral whirlpool designed fish cake that adds color to the overall
      Ramen appearance. 8. Kikurage or Wood Ear Mushrooms These thin, dark,
      floppy ear-shaped mushrooms are an elastic and chewy ingredient popular in
      China in food and as herbal medicine. They are also a great addition to
      different kinds of Ramen. 9. Butter and Corn Originally gaining popularity
      in Hokkaido butter and corn niblets are popular additions to Ramen,
      particularly miso Ramen. Sometimes the corn is simmered in butter and
      other times thick slices of butter are placed on the Ramen. 10. Beni Shoga
      Beni shoga is often found in tonkotsu Ramen. Pickled in plum vinegar, the
      reddish ginger has a strong sour flavor.
      <br />
      There are many other toppings like cabbage, kimchi, spinach, Japanese
      plum, and other pickled products that many regions and Ramen chefs
      experiment with as well.
      <br />
      Here are some of the most popular and distinct types of Ramen you will
      come across during your adventures in Japan. You will also find some shops
      that play with ingredients and sometimes mix and crossover Ramen types.
