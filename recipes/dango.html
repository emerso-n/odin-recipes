          dango are a nice little treat that is frequently enjoyed by the
          Japanese people. These small dumplings are made of rice flour, covered
          in a sweet sauce, and skewered on small bamboo sticks. Part of the
          mochi family of snacks, the dango is well known throughout the nation as
          a treat for good fortune and offerings to the gods. The sweet and
          salty treat that we know today is said to have originally come from a
          small tea store in Kyoto named Kamo Mitarashi, which is found near the
          Shimogamo Shrine. The name of these dessert balls is said to have
          originated from the corresponding image between the dumpling and the
          bubbles that come from the purifying waters, called mitarashi, in the
          entrance to the shrine.
          <br />
          These dumplings were originally made as a small offering to the gods
          and goddesses found in the shrine. The original mitarashi dango was
          originally made in the image of a person. It was skewered in groups of
          five dumplings. The top most dumpling would represent the head, the
          following two would represent the arms, and the remaining two would
          represent the legs of a person. The traditional colors of the mitarashi
          dango are red, white, and green.
          <br />
          The predecessor the modern day dango has been made by the Japanese
          since the early Jomon period, which spanned approximately from 1400 to
          300 BCE. This version of the dango was made using the nuts foraged from
          the forests of Japan. These nuts would then be pounded into a fine
          powder, into a form that is like flour. The powdered nuts would then
          be mixed in with gruel that was most likely made by boiling rice in
          water. This was essential to their survival as this meal would last
          them days during the winter seasons. It was later on that the mixture
          was incorporated with dumplings.
          <br />
          It was during the Muromachi period, which started in the year 1336 and
          ended in the year 1573, that the trend of having five dumpling
          skewered on a stick started. The onset of the Edo Period, which
          started in the year 1603 and ended in the year 1868, had seen a great
          increase in the partaking of the sweet dumpling snack. In fact, this
          was a time when the popular saying hana yori dango, which translates to
          “to enjoy the dumplings more than the cherry blossoms,” had become
          commonplace. It was only in the middle of the 18th century that four
          dumplings skewered on a stick had become popular.
          <br />
          It is during the Aoi Festival and the mitarashi Festival, both held at
          the Shimogamo Shrine, that these dumplings are most popular. Flocks of
          people come to the shrine during these times to offer the dumplings
          they brought, whether they bought it from a grocery store or made it
          themselves, to the deities. The Aoi Festival is said to be one of the
          biggest and most anticipated annual festivals in the city of Kyoto.
          This festival is visited by Japanese people from all over the country
          as it is considered to be the most dignified, formal, and elegant
          festival in the country. It has been this way since its conception in
          the eighth century. The festival had gained the present name of Aoi,
          which means hollyhock, during the Edo period as the festival goers
          would parade around the area with hollyhock leaves. The popularity of
          this festival is evident in the number of people who parade in it. A
          procession of 500 people, dressed in beautiful and ornate traditional
          clothes that resemble those of the imperial court, parade around
          carriages pulled by oxen. The festival starts with a private service
          for the imperial family, followed by a Shinto ritual, and ends with a
          procession that starts from the Kyoto Imperial Palace and ends in the
          Kamigamo Shrine. The Aoi Festival is often described by many Japanese
          people through the parade, the traditional imperial music, the ancient
          and graceful dances, and the dango that people consume by tradition.
          The Aoi Festival started during the Heian period, which started in the
          year 794 and ended in the year 1185. The court officials of the time
          had made a journey to offer their prayers at the Kamigamo Shrine and
          the Shimogamo Shrine. This parade had drawn the interest of many
          passersby and this event has since been a sight to behold. This
          festival is so popular that it has been referenced in many traditional
          pieces of art and literature numerous times. It is said that these
          court officials had also offered dango to the deities. One can partake
          of the festivities every 15th of May.

                  Combine 白玉粉 and 上新粉 flours in a bowl. Stir in warm water.
                  When the flour clumps together, start kneading until the dough
                  is smooth. Then combine into one huge dough ball
                </li>
                <li>
                  Divide the dough into eight equal pieces. Then divide each piece
                  into two balls
                </li>
                <li>
                  Shape into a smooth round ball. If the dough is cracking, apply
                  a small amount of water to the broken area to smooth it out
                </li>
                <li>
                  Boil a large pot of water on low heat. Once the water in the pot
                  is boiling, gently drop in each dumpling. Then cook for about
                  1-2 minutes. Remove the dumplings when they rise to the top.
                  Place the dumplings in iced water. Once cooled, drain well and
                  transfer to a tray

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Divide the dough into three separate pieces. Then, for the 花見
                  version, add one drop of pink food colouring into a single piece
                  and work it to make a pink dough ball. For 坊ちゃん, mix in 餡子
                  into a single piece and knead it together gently until the
                  colour is consistent
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next, add one teaspoon of water to 1 teaspoon of matcha powder
                  to make a paste. Then add the paste to a dough ball and gently
                  mix them
                </li>
                <li>
                  For 坊ちゃん, crack the eggs, separate the yolks and mix the

                  You will need to create the sweet 醤油 glaze. First, combine all
                  the ingredients in a saucepan without turning on the heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then turn on the heat and keep whisking until you get a thick
                  sauce. You can now remove the saucepan from the heat and
                  transfer the sauce to a container or bowl. Dip the skewered
                  dumplings into the sauce or glaze them with it
