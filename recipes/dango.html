          団子s are a nice little treat that is frequently enjoyed by the
          Japanese people. These small dumplings are made of rice flour, covered
          in a sweet sauce, and skewered on small bamboo sticks. Part of the
          餅粉 family of snacks, the 団子 is well known throughout the nation as
          a treat for good fortune and offerings to the gods. The sweet and
          salty treat that we know today is said to have originally come from a
          small tea store in 京都 named かも みたらし, which is found near the
          しもがも Shrine. The name of these dessert balls is said to have
          originated from the corresponding image between the dumpling and the
          bubbles that come from the purifying waters, called みたらし, in the
          entrance to the shrine.
          <br />
          These dumplings were originally made as a small offering to the gods
          and goddesses found in the shrine. The original みたらし 団子 was
          originally made in the image of a person. It was skewered in groups of
          five dumplings. The top most dumpling would represent the head, the
          following two would represent the arms, and the remaining two would
          represent the legs of a person. The traditional colors of the みたらし
          団子 are red, white, and green.
          <br />
          The predecessor the modern day 団子 has been made by the Japanese
          since the early Jomon period, which spanned approximately from 1400 to
          300 BCE. This version of the 団子 was made using the nuts foraged from
          the forests of Japan. These nuts would then be pounded into a fine
          powder, into a form that is like flour. The powdered nuts would then
          be mixed in with gruel that was most likely made by boiling rice in
          water. This was essential to their survival as this meal would last
          them days during the winter seasons. It was later on that the mixture
          was incorporated with dumplings.
          <br />
          It was during the Muromachi period, which started in the year 1336 and
          ended in the year 1573, that the trend of having five dumpling
          skewered on a stick started. The onset of the Edo Period, which
          started in the year 1603 and ended in the year 1868, had seen a great
          increase in the partaking of the sweet dumpling snack. In fact, this
          was a time when the popular saying hana yori 団子, which translates to
          “to enjoy the dumplings more than the cherry blossoms,” had become
          commonplace. It was only in the middle of the 18th century that four
          dumplings skewered on a stick had become popular.
          <br />
          It is during the Aoi Festival and the みたらし Festival, both held at
          the Shimogamo Shrine, that these dumplings are most popular. Flocks of
          people come to the shrine during these times to offer the dumplings
          they brought, whether they bought it from a grocery store or made it
          themselves, to the deities. The Aoi Festival is said to be one of the
          biggest and most anticipated annual festivals in the city of Kyoto.
          This festival is visited by Japanese people from all over the country
          as it is considered to be the most dignified, formal, and elegant
          festival in the country. It has been this way since its conception in
          the eighth century. The festival had gained the present name of Aoi,
          which means hollyhock, during the Edo period as the festival goers
          would parade around the area with hollyhock leaves. The popularity of
          this festival is evident in the number of people who parade in it. A
          procession of 500 people, dressed in beautiful and ornate traditional
          clothes that resemble those of the imperial court, parade around
          carriages pulled by oxen. The festival starts with a private service
          for the imperial family, followed by a Shinto ritual, and ends with a
          procession that starts from the Kyoto Imperial Palace and ends in the
          Kamigamo Shrine. The Aoi Festival is often described by many Japanese
          people through the parade, the traditional imperial music, the ancient
          and graceful dances, and the 団子 that people consume by tradition.
          The Aoi Festival started during the Heian period, which started in the
          year 794 and ended in the year 1185. The court officials of the time
          had made a journey to offer their prayers at the Kamigamo Shrine and
          the Shimogamo Shrine. This parade had drawn the interest of many
          passersby and this event has since been a sight to behold. This
          festival is so popular that it has been referenced in many traditional
          pieces of art and literature numerous times. It is said that these
          court officials had also offered 団子 to the deities. One can partake
          of the festivities every 15th of May.
          <br />
          The みたらし Festival is held every July. This is a very popular
          summer festival. This season in Kyoto is often described as hot and
          humid and the みたらし Festival allows people to enjoy the festivities
          while keeping cool. The aim of this festival is to purify the people
          of Japan. It is its sole purpose if you will. By removing the
          impurities in one's body, the people believe that they are restored to
          a healthy and lively state. The Shinto belief is that the waters will
          cleanse your soul and will, in turn, allow you to shine brighter both
          physically and spiritually. This festival is very popular as it is
          done in order to promise an illness-free year, specifically in the
          lower region of the body. The purifying waters that are used in the
          festival originated from an underground stream. This underground water
          is extremely cold and is full of minerals. Those who participate in
          the rituals of this festival pay around two hundred yen to buy a
          candle and wade upstream. Then, they push through the icy cold water
          in order to set a candle before the Inoue Shrine, which houses the
          deity of purification. This purification ritual lasts four days from
          which thousands of festival goers wade through the knee-high and
          extremely cold waters in kimonos, or in some cases folded up pants.
          Those who go through the purifying waters get to drink a cup of the
          cleansing water at the end. People may also find black stones at the
          end of the stream which has special spiritual properties that provide
          protection from ominous and demonic forces. These stones are believed
          to relieve temper tantrums in children as it drives the negative
          energies away from them. To obtain these stones, a donation of
          equivalent value must be made to the shrine. It is part of the
          festival experience for those who did the purification ritual to buy
          みたらし 団子s at the stalls located by the shrine as the 団子s are
          made to resemble the bubbles that float out of the water.

                  Combine 白玉粉 and 上新粉 flours in a bowl. Stir in warm
                  water. When the flour clumps together, start kneading until
                  the dough is smooth. Then combine into one huge dough ball
                </li>
                <li>
                  Divide the dough into eight equal pieces. Then divide each

                <li>
                  Shape into a smooth round ball. If the dough is cracking,
                  apply a small amount of water to the broken area to smooth it

                <li>
                  Boil a large pot of water on low heat. Once the water in the
                  pot is boiling, gently drop in each dumpling. Then cook for
                  about 1-2 minutes. Remove the dumplings when they rise to the
                  top. Place the dumplings in iced water. Once cooled, drain

                  Divide the dough into three separate pieces. Then, for the
                  花見 version, add one drop of pink food colouring into a
                  single piece and work it to make a pink dough ball. For
                  坊ちゃん, mix in 餡子 into a single piece and knead it
                  together gently until the colour is consistent

                <li>
                  Next, add one teaspoon of water to 1 teaspoon of matcha powder

                  You will need to create the sweet 醤油 glaze. First, combine

                  Then turn on the heat and keep whisking until you get a thick
                  sauce. You can now remove the saucepan from the heat and
                  transfer the sauce to a container or bowl. Dip the skewered
